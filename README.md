A program to simulate electrons and gammas from a radioactive source (e.g. SR-90, Am-241) interacting with pixel sensors. Shielding and triggering can be simulated and the setup (e.g. geometry, materials) can be easily changed.

The program uses the GEANT4 framework. 
The corresponding GEANT4 license can be found here:

This software is under heavy development right now. Nevertheless only compiling revisions are comitted to the master branch. The Readme/wiki will be build soon. So far: Please contact the author if you have any questions.
